# Cypress Automation Mastery Tutorial

Welcome to the Cypress Automation Mastery Tutorial! This guide is a showcase of my technical prowess with Cypress, aimed at beginners as well as intermediate users. In this tutorial, I will guide you through the process of installing Cypress and crafting your first automation test. I've created this tutorial to demonstrate my adeptness with Cypress and my ability to document processes clearly in Github pull requests.

While I might not have a formal degree, I believe that the knowledge and skills I've acquired in the field are substantial. This tutorial is designed to fill in any perceived gaps in my skillset and provide tangible evidence of my capabilities.

## Introduction

Cypress is an incredibly powerful JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework. It lets you craft tests for your applications that mimic actual user behavior, which makes it easier to identify and resolve issues before they reach your users.

## Prerequisites

Before you can dive into Cypress, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you don't have these installed, you can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

With Node.js and npm installed, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you plan to install Cypress. Then, input the following command:

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

This command directs npm (the Node Package Manager) to download the Cypress package and save it as a development dependency in your project.

## Writing Your First Test

Once Cypress is installed, you're ready to start writing your first test. In the cypress/integration directory, create a new file called sample_spec.js and input the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
describe('My First Test', function() {
  it('Does not do much!', function() {
    expect(true).to.equal(true)
  })
})
```

This code outlines a basic test that verifies that true is indeed equal to true.

Running Your Test
To run your test, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select your test and run it.

Running Your Test To execute your test, use the following command in your terminal:

```
npx cypress open
```

This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select your test and run it.

## Next Steps

Congrats on crafting and running your first Cypress test! From this point, you can delve deeper into the functionalities of Cypress by writing more intricate tests. You could also peruse the Cypress API to learn about the various commands you can incorporate into your tests.
